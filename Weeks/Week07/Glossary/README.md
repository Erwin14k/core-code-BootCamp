### Abstraction
 
Abstraction is the concept of object-oriented programming that "shows" only essential attributes and "hides" unnecessary information. The main purpose of abstraction is hiding the unnecessary details from the users.

### Access Modifiers

Access Modifiers (Access Specifiers) are keywords that are used in OOP (object-oriented programming) in order to specify the accessibility of the methods, classes, constructors, and other members of the class.

### Class

In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

### Constructors

A constructor is a special method of a class or structure in object-oriented programming that initializes a newly created object of that type. Whenever an object is created, the constructor is called automatically.

### Encapsulation

In object-oriented computer programming (OOP) languages, the notion of encapsulation (or OOP Encapsulation) refers to the bundling of data, along with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit. Many programming languages use encapsulation frequently in the form of classes.


### Inheritance

It is a mechanism where you can to derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods.

### Instance

In object-oriented programming (OOP), an instance is a specific realization of any object. An object may be different in several ways, and each realized variation of that object is an instance. The creation of a realized instance is called instantiation.

### Interface

In Object Oriented Programming, an Interface is a description of all functions that an object must have in order to be an "X". Again, as an example, anything that "ACTS LIKE" a light, should have a turn_on() method and a turn_off() method.

### Object

In object-oriented programming (OOP), objects are the things you think about first in designing a program and they are also the units of code that are eventually derived from the process.


### Polymorphism

Polymorphism is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) and describes situations in which something occurs in several different forms. In computer science, it describes the concept that you can access objects of different types through the same interface.
