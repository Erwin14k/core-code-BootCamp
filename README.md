# Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages
Interpreted and compiled programming languaes have many differences, in this space I will mention some of theese.
I think the most important characteristic of the compiled programming languages is that they need to be converted into a machine code, so with this, they trend to be more efficient at execute. 
# Some Examples of Compiled Programming Languages:
- C++
- C
- Go
- Rust
The interpreted programming languages donÂ´t need a machile cood to be compiled, they have the peculiarity that run through a program line by line, so this programming languages execute each command.
# Some Examples of Interpreted Programming Languages:
- JavaScript
- Python
- Ruby
- PHP

# Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both?
